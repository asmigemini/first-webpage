<h2>Natue</h2>
<p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.</p>
<br>
<p>Nature is the mother of all, as it helps to sustain our life. It is our companion since eternity. Despite the importance of nature in human life, we are spoiling its balance only due to our greediness. Millions of years ago, when the knowledge of man was not better than an animal. At that time man used to get all the things needed for life only from nature. Even today, at the heights of science, our requirements are met by nature only. Nature is a boon given to us, as it protects crores and crores of organisms living on the earth. It gives us forests which are the lungs of Earth.</p>

<h3 align=center>oceans</h3>
An<span class="name"> ocean </span>is a major body of saline water, and a principal component of the hydrosphere. Approximately 71% of the Earth's surface (an area of some 361 million square kilometers) is covered by ocean, a continuous body of water that is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas. More than half of this area is over 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) deep. Average oceanic salinity is around 35 parts per thousand (ppt) (3.5%), and nearly all seawater has a salinity in the range of 30 to 38 ppt. Though generally recognized as several 'separate' oceans, these waters comprise one global, interconnected body of salt water often referred to as the World Ocean or global ocean.

<h3 align=center>Conservation of Nature</h3>
Conservation of nature is another important issue. Although governments are employing various means to conserve nature, individuals must also come forward to contribute to saving nature. Therefore, everyone must do the tree plantation, restricting the use of paper, stopping wastage of water and electricity. Not only these we have to stop ill practices like the hunting of animals. Also, we must go for rainwater harvesting systems. If each one of us contributes their own bit, the difference will be tremendous for nature. The beginning of life, as well as the continuation of life on earth both, are a very complex process of nature. Every organism is important for the conservation of nature.
